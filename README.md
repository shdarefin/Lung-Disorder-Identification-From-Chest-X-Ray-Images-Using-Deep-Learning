# Lung-Disorder-Identification-From-Chest-X-Ray-Images-Using-Deep-Learning
The diagnosis and treatment of lung illnesses are extremely difficult. In this study, deep learning models were used to identify lung disorders from chest X-ray images. The goal is to use CNN-based transfer learning to detect and categorize various lung illnesses, such as pneumonia, COVID-19, and normal, automatically.
